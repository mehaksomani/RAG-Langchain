       "Document(metadata={'source': 'test.txt'}, page_content=\"The sun dipped below the horizon, casting a golden hue across the quiet valley. \\nA distant train whistle echoed through the evening air, adding a nostalgic charm to the silence. \\nBirds rustled in the trees as they settled in for the night. Somewhere nearby, a dog barked once and then fell quiet. \\nThe air smelled faintly of pine and woodsmoke. \\nInside a small cabin, a kettle began to whistle softly on the stove. \\nIt was the kind of peaceful moment that rarely lasted, but always lingered in memory.\\nArtificial intelligence is transforming the way we interact with technology on a daily basis. From personalized recommendations on streaming platforms to advanced language models capable of writing code and answering questions, AI is becoming deeply embedded in modern life. The rapid pace of innovation also brings challenges related to data privacy, ethical decision-making, and the need for regulatory oversight. As we continue to explore the capabilities of intelligent systems, it becomes crucial to balance technological advancement with responsibility and transparency.\\n\\nIn fields like healthcare, AI is helping doctors diagnose diseases earlier and more accurately. \\nFinancial institutions are using AI to detect fraudulent transactions in real-time. \\nEven agriculture is benefiting, with machine learning optimizing crop yields and predicting weather patterns. \\nEducation, too, is seeing changes as AI tutors and adaptive learning systems tailor content to individual students' needs.\\nHowever, the rise of AI has sparked debate about job displacement, algorithmic bias, and the long-term risks of artificial general intelligence. It's essential that AI development remains inclusive, with diverse voices contributing to how these systems are built and deployed. Public trust will depend not only on performance, but on how transparent and accountable these technologies are.\\n\\n\")"
